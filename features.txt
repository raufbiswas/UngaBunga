Tagging/Categories (Optional):

	•	If you want to support tagging or categorizing posts, consider adding a many-to-many relationship between Posts and Categories through a junction table, which you seem to have already.

Post Status (Optional):

	•	You might want to add a status column if posts can be drafts, published, or archived.

Extended Metadata (Optional):

	•	If you need additional metadata, such as a view count or like count, you can add these columns.
